											<strong>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</strong><br><br>
											
											<strong>Iteration in Nature:</strong><br>
											Iteration refers to repeating a process or sequence of steps until a goal is achieved. In nature, we see iteration in several ways:<br>
											- <strong>Animal Migration:</strong> Birds, fish, and mammals follow repetitive paths during seasonal migrations, repeating the same steps until they reach their destination.<br>
											- <strong>Tree Growth:</strong> Trees add one growth ring each year in a repetitive pattern, continuing this process over many years.<br>
											- <strong>Foraging Behavior:</strong> Ants and bees use repetitive searching patterns to find food, continuing their efforts until they succeed.<br>
											- <strong>Heartbeat and Breathing:</strong> The processes of heartbeat and breathing repeat continuously to sustain life.<br><br>
											
											<strong>Recursion in Nature:</strong><br>
											Recursion involves self-similar structures or behaviors where a process repeats at smaller scales. Examples of recursion in nature include:<br>
											- <strong>Tree Branching:</strong> The way trees and plants grow with smaller branches resembling the larger ones, following a recursive pattern.<br>
											- <strong>Snowflakes:</strong> Snowflakes form symmetrical, self-similar patterns at different levels, displaying recursion.<br>
											- <strong>Food Chains:</strong> In ecosystems, the relationship between predator and prey repeats in a self-similar manner, with smaller organisms playing roles similar to larger ones.<br>
											- <strong>Spirals in Shells and Galaxies:</strong> Many natural spirals, such as those in nautilus shells or galaxies, exhibit recursive structures.<br><br>
											
											<strong>Backtracking in Nature:</strong><br>
											Backtracking is the process of exploring paths and retracing steps when one route fails. Examples in nature include:<br>
											- <strong>Ant Foraging:</strong> Ants backtrack when they reach a dead-end, retracing their steps to try another path in their search for food.<br>
											- <strong>Predator Hunting:</strong> Predators like big cats may backtrack during hunting, trying different approaches when an initial strategy fails.<br>
											- <strong>Bees Searching for Nectar:</strong> Bees backtrack to previous flowers when they don’t find nectar at a new one.<br>
											- <strong>Maze Navigation by Rats:</strong> Rats exhibit backtracking in mazes, retracing their steps to find an alternative path when they hit a dead-end.<br><br>
											
											<strong>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</strong><br><br>
											
											<strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Refers to how quickly an algorithm executes relative to the size of the input. Measured by time complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n)).<br>
											<strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Measured by space complexity.<br><br>
											
											<strong>Why They Matter:</strong><br>
											- <strong>Optimized Resource Use:</strong> Efficient algorithms ensure smooth performance.<br>
											- <strong>Real-World Constraints:</strong> Vital in environments with limited resources (e.g., mobile apps, embedded systems).<br>
											- <strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Balancing both optimizes overall system performance.<br><br>
											
											<strong>3. Orders of Growth</strong><br>
											Here’s a list of common orders of growth with examples:<br>
											<table border="1">
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>Order of Growth</th>
														<th>Example</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>O(1) - Constant time</td>
														<td>Array element access</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(log n) - Logarithmic time</td>
														<td>Binary search</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(n) - Linear time</td>
														<td>Finding maximum in an unsorted array</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(n log n) - Log-linear time</td>
														<td>MergeSort, QuickSort</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(n²) - Quadratic time</td>
														<td>BubbleSort, InsertionSort</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(n³) - Cubic time</td>
														<td>Naive matrix multiplication</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(2^n) - Exponential time</td>
														<td>Brute force solution for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>O(n!) - Factorial time</td>
														<td>Generating all permutations of a set</td>

											<strong>4. Take Away from Different Design Principles</strong><br>
											1. Decomposition: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.<br>
											2. Pattern Recognition: Identify recurring patterns to generalize solutions.<br>
											3. Abstraction: Simplify systems by focusing on essential features.<br>
											4. Pruning: Eliminate unnecessary parts to save resources.<br>
											5. Lazy Propagation: Defer updates until necessary.<br>
											6. Sliding Window: Process overlapping sub-arrays efficiently.<br>
											7. Level Order Traversal: Explore tree structures level by level.<br>
											8. Hierarchical Data: Organize data in parent-child relationships.<br>
											9. Edge Relaxation: Update shortest known distances in graphs.<br>
											10. Balancing and Rotations: Maintain balance in tree structures.<br>
											11. Kleene Closure: Find all possible connections or paths.<br>
											12. Pre-Computing: Store results to speed up queries.<br>
											13. Parental Dominance: Parent nodes dominate child nodes.<br>
											14. Prefix and Suffix: Optimize searches with precomputed arrays.<br>
											15. Partitioning: Divide data for better management.<br>
											16. Bit Manipulations: Optimize operations using bitwise techniques.<br>
											17. Memoization: Cache results to avoid redundant computation.<br><br>
